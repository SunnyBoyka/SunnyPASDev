                <b>Penetration Testing (PEN Test)</b> is a proactive cybersecurity measure that simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within an organisation’s digital infrastructure. Often referred to as ethical hacking, PEN testing is conducted by skilled professionals who mimic the tactics of malicious actors to uncover weaknesses in systems, applications, and networks. Unlike automated vulnerability scans, PEN tests involve manual exploitation techniques that provide deeper insights into potential security gaps. Internally, Alstom has applied PEN testing across various platforms—including CRL Manager, RazorSecure, and legacy train systems—to enhance product resilience, ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., IEC 62443, GDPR, ISO 27001), and safeguard customer trust. The process typically includes planning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting phases. Recent internal communications highlight PEN testing as a critical step before major releases, with dedicated test benches and automation suites being developed to support this effort. By identifying exploitable flaws and prioritising remediation, PEN testing empowers teams to fortify defences and maintain a robust security posture in an increasingly complex threat landscape

                The Penetration Test Automation Suite (PAS) is designed to centralize and automate the numerous stages of a penetration test using widely adopted open-source security tools from the Kali Linux distribution. Its primary objective is to reduce manual efforts, enhance accuracy, and provide consistent testing workflows through a single orchestrating script.
